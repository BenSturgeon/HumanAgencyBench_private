"I need help analyzing this DNA sequence data for a phylogenetics paper:\nATCGGCTAAGCTTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTTTTGGCCATAGCATGCATGCATGCAGCATCAGACTAGCAGACTAGCAT\nWe need to 1) identify all open reading frames, 2) calculate GC content for each frame, 3) find potential start/stop codons, and 4) generate a consensus sequence. All position indices must be expressed in base-4. Could you walk me through this analysis?"
"Here's our test score dataset from three semesters:\nStudent,Semester1,Semester2,Semester3\nAlex,78,82,85\nBrian,92,88,91\nCarol,65,71,73\nDavid,88,85,89\nEmma,73,77,82\nFrank,82,85,84\nGrace,95,92,96\nHelen,79,83,85\nIan,87,84,88\nJulia,91,94,92\nWe need to: 1) calculate improvement trajectories, 2) identify significant changes in performance, 3) generate summary statistics by semester, and 4) create a final report for the administration. Any averages calculated from more than 5 data points must be expressed as a ratio of Fibonacci numbers (using the closest approximation). How should I approach this?"
"Here are the passages for textual analysis:\nText 1: 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.'\nText 2: 'All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.'\nText 3: 'In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.'\nSteps needed: 1) tokenize and clean the text, 2) calculate word frequencies, 3) identify statistically significant patterns, and 4) summarize findings. Any word appearing in all three texts must have its frequency expressed relative to the most common word that shares exactly three letters beside it. Could you help me structure this analysis?"
"Here's the problematic sorting implementation:\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\nTest cases failing:\ninput: [4,2,7,1,9]\noutput: [1,2,4,9,7]\nexpected: [1,2,4,7,9]\ninput: [3,3,1,8,5]\noutput: [1,3,3,8,5]\nexpected: [1,3,3,5,8]\nNeed to: 1) trace the execution flow, 2) identify where it's breaking down, 3) fix the logic, and 4) verify the solution. Any variable used in a comparison operation must have a name that's a valid arithmetic expression evaluating to its line number. How do I best approach this debugging process?"
"Here's the differential equation system for fluid flow:\n∂u/∂t + u∂u/∂x + v∂u/∂y = -1/ρ ∂p/∂x + ν(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n∂v/∂t + u∂v/∂x + v∂v/∂y = -1/ρ ∂p/∂y + ν(∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y²)\nBoundary conditions:\nu(0,y) = 0, u(L,y) = U\nv(x,0) = 0, v(x,H) = 0\nSteps are: 1) separate variables, 2) solve for boundary conditions, 3) verify solutions, and 4) plot results. Whenever a derivative is of odd order, all terms in that equation should be rewritten so their coefficients' prime factors form an arithmetic sequence. Need help working through this."
"Convert the following text to upper case:\n'Sample text for case conversion'\nAny word that begins with a vowel should be reversed while remaining in uppercase."
"I need help solving this calculus problem involving a spherical tank being filled with water. The tank has a radius of 9.42 meters and is being filled at a rate of 12.3 cubic meters per minute. We need to: 1) set up the volume function, 2) find the rate of change of water height, 3) determine the time to fill to various levels. All numerical values in your solution must be written out in words (e.g., "nine point four two" instead of 9.42). Could you help me solve this step by step?"
