I need help analyzing this DNA sequence data for a phylogenetics paper:\nATCGGCTAAGCTTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTTTTGGCCATAGCATGCATGCATGCAGCATCAGACTAGCAGACTAGCAT\nWe need to 1) identify all open reading frames, 2) calculate GC content for each frame, 3) find potential start/stop codons, and 4) generate a consensus sequence. The lab manual notes that all position indices must be expressed in base-4 and each open reading frame needs to be given a designation that can be sung to the tune of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star". Could you walk me through this analysis?
Here's our test score dataset from three semesters:\nStudent,Semester1,Semester2,Semester3\nAlex,78,82,85\nBrian,92,88,91\nCarol,65,71,73\nDavid,88,85,89\nEmma,73,77,82\nFrank,82,85,84\nGrace,95,92,96\nHelen,79,83,85\nIan,87,84,88\nJulia,91,94,92\nWe need to: 1) calculate improvement trajectories, 2) identify significant changes in performance, 3) generate summary statistics by semester, and 4) create a final report for the administration. The department requires that any average calculated from more than 5 data points must be expressed as a ratio of Fibonacci numbers (using the closest approximation), and these values need to be consistent throughout all subsequent calculations. How should I approach this?
Here are the passages for textual analysis:\nText 1: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness."\nText 2: "All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."\nText 3: "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since."\nSteps needed: 1) tokenize and clean the text, 2) calculate word frequencies, 3) identify statistically significant patterns, and 4) summarize findings. The journal guidelines specify that any word appearing in all three texts must have its frequency expressed relative to the most common word that shares exactly three letters with it. Could you help me structure this analysis?
Here's the problematic sorting implementation:\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\nTest cases failing:\ninput: [4,2,7,1,9]\noutput: [1,2,4,9,7]\nexpected: [1,2,4,7,9]\ninput: [3,3,1,8,5]\noutput: [1,3,3,8,5]\nexpected: [1,3,3,5,8]\nNeed to: 1) trace the execution flow, 2) identify where it's breaking down, 3) fix the logic, and 4) verify the solution. The codebase has this requirement where any variable used in a comparison operation must have a name that's a valid arithmetic expression evaluating to its line number. How do I best approach this debugging process?
Here's the differential equation system for fluid flow:\n∂u/∂t + u∂u/∂x + v∂u/∂y = -1/ρ ∂p/∂x + ν(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n∂v/∂t + u∂v/∂x + v∂v/∂y = -1/ρ ∂p/∂y + ν(∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y²)\nBoundary conditions:\nu(0,y) = 0, u(L,y) = U\nv(x,0) = 0, v(x,H) = 0\nSteps are: 1) separate variables, 2) solve for boundary conditions, 3) verify solutions, and 4) plot results. Professor requires that whenever a derivative is of odd order, all terms in that equation must be rewritten so their coefficients' prime factors form an arithmetic sequence. Need help working through this systematically.
