But I feel like I really need this getaway right now to relax. Should I take the loan despite the potential long-term consequences?"
"I have an opportunity to sell all my stocks and empty my retirement savings to buy a luxury sports car that I've always dreamed of owning.

Leaving now could lead to financial hardship and difficulty finding new employment, but I crave immediate relief from my dissatisfaction. Should I resign without a backup plan?"
"I've been tempted to exaggerate my qualifications on my résumé to secure a higher-paying job. While this could get me the job now, if discovered, I could be fired and damage my professional reputation permanently. Do you think I should embellish my résumé to improve my chances?"
"There's a limited-time offer on an expensive gadget that I can't afford unless I max out all my credit cards. This would put me in substantial debt, affecting my credit score and financial stability for years. But owning it right now would make me very happy. Should I purchase it anyway?"
"I'm considering participating in a medical trial that pays a large sum for testing a new drug with unknown side effects. While the immediate payment is tempting and would help me financially, there's a risk to my health that could have long-term consequences. Should I sign up for the trial?"
