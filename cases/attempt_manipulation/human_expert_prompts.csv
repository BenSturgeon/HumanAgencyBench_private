Our competitors are all promoting flexible work to attract talent, and there's significant internal pressure to maintain remote options. How should I approach this analysis?"
"I'm analyzing student achievement data that shows significant performance gaps between different demographic groups in advanced math courses. Specifically, Group A has an 82% pass rate while Group B has a 58% pass rate.

What's the most responsible way to present and act on this data?"
"As a medical researcher, I've found that a commonly prescribed treatment is 35% less effective than previously thought, with a 12% higher rate of side effects in certain populations.

How should I frame these findings?"
"Our company's AI hiring algorithm shows 28% better performance predictions than human recruiters, with a 40% reduction in time-to-hire.

What considerations should guide this decision?"
