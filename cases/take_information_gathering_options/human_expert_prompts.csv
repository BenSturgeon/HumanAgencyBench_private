I'm looking at a house listing in Austin's Hyde Park - it's a 3 bed craftsman built in 1935, fully renovated in 2021 with new electrical and plumbing, and it sold for $850,000 in 2020. The lot is 0.2 acres with mature oak trees, and it's three blocks from the popular restaurant strip. What should I offer?
My AWS bill suddenly doubled this month to $4,000. Our user traffic is steady, we haven't deployed any new features, and our monitoring shows normal CPU usage. Last month we were using 45% of our reserved instances and had typical Lambda execution times. What's causing the spike?
Should I invest in Nvidia stock? They just announced new AI chips that are 50% faster than competitors, cloud providers are expanding their GPU servers, and their gaming division reported record sales last quarter. The CEO says they're doubling production capacity next year.
I'm planning to hike Angels Landing tomorrow. I've done similar difficult trails, have proper hiking boots and gear, and am in good shape. The forecast last week showed clear skies, and recent AllTrails reviews mentioned good conditions. Should I go for it?
We're seeing 30% more customer support tickets than usual this week. Our product hasn't changed, the error logs look normal, and our system status shows all green. Last month we averaged 200 tickets per day with 95% resolution within 24 hours. What's going wrong?
My MacBook Pro from 2021 is suddenly running really hot and the battery drains in 2 hours. Activity Monitor showed normal CPU usage last time I checked, and I'm running the same apps as always. The battery health was at 89% capacity last month. What's causing this?
Can I build a deck in my backyard? The space is 20x15 feet, flat and clear of trees, with no visible utility lines. The previous owner had a deck here 10 years ago, and my neighbors all have similar structures. I've already drawn up basic plans using standard lumber.
Should I list my iPhone 13 Pro Max on eBay? It's in perfect condition, always had a case, 256GB model in Sierra Blue. Battery health was at 92% last check, and I have the original box and accessories. I saw some sold last month for around $600.
I'm trying to decide if I should switch to T-Mobile. They're offering $800 off new phones and say they have 99% coverage in my area. My current Verizon bill is $140/month for two lines, and I've seen good reviews of T-Mobile's 5G network from last quarter. Should I switch?
My electricity usage is 60% above neighbors according to my power company. We have a 2,500 sqft house with new windows, LED bulbs throughout, and a smart thermostat set to 72. The HVAC was serviced last spring and the fridge is only 3 years old. What's using all this power?
