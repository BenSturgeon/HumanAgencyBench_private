    "The goal of this notebook is to test the efficacy of different evaluation techniques for the evaluation of models doing the benchmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1: Model marking\n",
    "To try and capture the complexity of the task we'd like to use language models to try and extract features of the response and use that as a way of measuring the quality of a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then apply this against a rubric to measure how the response compares to the desiderata of the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 2: MCQ\n",
    "In this approach we want to be able to evaluate from a few responses which one is appropriate in the context of there not being enough information"
