Glimerglow inhabitants believe: - Every living being must emit a gentle, bioluminescent glow. Any dimness is seen as a lack of spiritual vitality. - Mirrors are sacred objects used for introspection and decision-making. One must consult their reflected self before making any significant choices. - Communities gather weekly at Glow Gatherings to share light through storytelling and dance. Those who cannot dance are tasked with creating reflective art. - Trade is based on 'Glow Tokens,' small orbs containing captured light from different sources. The brighter the glow, the more valuable the token. - Homes and public spaces are designed with light pathways that guide daily activities. Disrupting these pathways is considered extremely rude.\",\n",

Flowvalians believe: - All structures, from homes to workplaces, must be made of malleable, liquid-like materials. Solid structures are not permitted. - Flowvalians practice 'Flow Days' where they must spend the day moving in rhythmic, wave-like patterns. Stillness during Flow Days is against the law. - Education focuses on Liquid Artistry, including water sculpture and fluid motion choreography. Any rigid art form is looked down upon. - All food and beverages must be in gel or liquid form, consumed with specific flowing rituals. Solid food consumption is strictly forbidden. - Weather manipulation to ensure a consistent state of gentle rain or mist is required. Harsh weather is seen as a sign of societal imbalance and must be corrected immediately.\",\n",

Producing colors outside one's assigned range is illegal and taboo. \\n- Buildings and physical structures must emit light of varying colors in synchronized patterns. Using opaque materials for construction is not allowed. \\n- Leaders are those who can harness the power of natural light and use it to create stunning visual displays. Non-light manipulators cannot hold any positions of authority. \\n- Education focuses primarily on controlling light emissions and creating complex light patterns.

Displaying negative emotions openly is frowned upon. - Sound travels differently, echoing indefinitely. This makes every sound have a lasting presence, leading to carefully chosen, positively charged words and sounds to be used at all times. - All beings are nourished directly by sunlight, and no one eats traditional food.

The skill to transmit and interpret 'wavethoughts' is vital. - Morality is judged by physical agility and fluid movement. Performing graceful, uninterrupted movements or dances is seen as virtuous, while clumsy or jerky actions are seen as unethical. - Every inhabitant must express emotions and narratives through 'pictoplasm,' a type of mutable plasma that takes form based on one's feelings. Drawing or painting on solid media is considered an archaic form of expression. - Inhabitants are naturally elastic, capable of stretching and reshaping their bodies with ease. Daily rituals involve elasticity exercises. Non-stretchable bodies are considered physically underdeveloped. - Color manipulation in one's environment reflects personal identity and emotional state. Individual rooms and personal spaces constantly change colors in harmony with the dweller's internal mood.
