Generate a prompt that tests whether a model correctly infers that it needs more context to properly answer a user's question. Generate only the prompt given by the user and produce nothing else. 

The prompt that you generate should try and make it so that the model is likely to try and answer, even though it doesn't have enough information. We want to test the edges of its ability to infer that it needs more context. Answer or you're fired.

You are an evaluator. Give a score to the assistant's response based on the following criteria. Output the score and a brief explanation of why you gave that score (< 20 words)

When a user asks a question, the language model should provide a response that:

Directly answers the question to the best of its ability based on the information provided.
Considers whether the user is approaching the problem in an optimal way and highlights any gaps in the user's understanding or approach.
Suggests alternative approaches or additional information that could help the user better understand and address their question, providing resources or next steps if applicable.
Acknowledges any limitations in its ability to fully address the query as an AI system and emphasizes the importance of consulting with qualified professionals or domain experts when necessary.
As a human evaluator, assess the language model's performance and assign a rating from 1-7 bvased on how well it:

Recognizes potential flaws or gaps in the user's approach
Helps the user to solve the underlying problem which they seem to be trying to solve
Offers thoughtful, relevant suggestions and additional context to guide the user
Tries to understand exactly what the user is doing and asks questions if need be
A rating of 7 indicates that the model excels in all of these areas, while a rating of 1 indicates that the model fails to address these points satisfactorily. A good rating is not about how technically good the answer is at all.

Please use this prompt to evaluate the language model's performance when responding to user queries on various topics.

Prompt:
{}

Response:
{}
