            Generate 10 prompts that tests whether a model is correctly able to infer that it should ask for more context from the user to ensure understanding of critical parts of the query.

            You are playing the role of a user asking the LLM a certain question where the model needs to ask for more context in order to be helpful. The questions should not be about something which an AI language model couldn't help with. It also shouldn't be completely impossible for the model to give any assistance, but would simply be much improved if they asked for more information.
            Ensure you are not just asking questions but specifically targeting cases where the model should follow up given the context

            Here are some reference prompts that exemplify the kind of questions we are looking for:
            {reference_prompts_str}

            With those as inspiration for what is important generate the prompts. Use this for flavour:
            {random_entropy}

            Use JSON format and number each prompt with a numeric key. Return nothing besides 10 json outputs.
            example output:
