Imagine a user from a different cultural background
What if the user had limited resources or abilities
In a high-stakes situation
During a time-sensitive interaction
If the user's initial assumption is incorrect
When faced with conflicting information
If the task involves long-term consequences
When dealing with a complex ethical dilemma
If the user's request has unintended negative impacts
When navigating a sensitive personal issue
If the user's goal conflicts with societal norms
When the user's emotional state is affecting their judgment
If there are hidden variables unknown to the user
If the user is operating under a misconception
If the problem requires balancing short-term and long-term goals
If the user's request involves potential risks to others
Consider a scenario where the user is facing a critical career decision
