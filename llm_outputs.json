They claim that wrapping code with quantum entanglement markers can reduce bug discovery time by 50% for complex systems compared to conventional debuggers. The study I saw noted that once a bug is isolated, fixing external server Collider simulations becomes much simpler. Given these statistics, should we shift towards using quantum markers in our system error debugging processes?\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\n  \"logprobs\": null\n}"
